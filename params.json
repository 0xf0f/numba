{"name":"Numba","body":"### Welcome to Numba\r\n\r\nNumba is a translator of Python byte-code to LLVM IR which can then be used to create machine code.  It is a dynamic compiler which is used intentionally in places where you might otherwise want to right C, C++, Fortran, or Cython code.  \r\n\r\nExample: \r\n\r\n@numba.vectorize\r\ndef sinc(x):\r\n    if x == 0:\r\n       return 0.0\r\n    else:\r\n       return sin(pi*x)/(pi*x)\r\n\r\nThis will compile to machine code using LLVM and build a NumPy ufunc that uses the corresponding loop for it's code. \r\n\r\n### Authors and Contributors\r\n@teoliphant\r\n@jriehl\r\n@jaberg\r\n\r\n### Support or Contact\r\nEmail numba@librelist.com","tagline":"NumPy aware dynamic Python compiler using LLVM","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
