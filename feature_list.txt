 * Integration with strings of C/C++ and Fortran
 * caching mechanism for compiled functions
 * byte-code optimizations (i.e. local variable elimination, attribute lookup-lifting, constant expression, etc.)
 * multi-core support
 * simple GPU support
 * array-expression optimizations and loop-analysis (e.g. polly)
 * profiling tools (heat-map based on hot spots)
 * tools for writing extension modules (as .bc modules) and creating shared-libraries directly from Python
 * "freezing" Python applications (removing interpreter and leaving just libpython dependency)
