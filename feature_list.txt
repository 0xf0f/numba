 * Integration with strings of C/C++ and Fortran
 * caching mechanism for compiled functions
 * byte-code optimizations (i.e. local variable elimination, attribute lookup-lifting, constant expression, etc.)
 * multi-core support
 * simple GPU support
 * array-expression optimizations and loop-analysis (e.g. polly)
 * profiling tools (heat-map based on hot spots)
 * tools for writing extension modules (as .bc modules) and creating shared-libraries directly from Python
 * "freezing" Python applications (removing interpreter and leaving just libpython dependency)
 * parsing C or C++headers to create LLVM-structures 
 * Ship Cython as well along with improved version of Cwrap to auto-generate wrappers using LLVM for call-backs
 * ??integration with Java through JNI
 * ??integration with .NET (Python .NET)
 * FPGA interface --- integrating with Xilinx (we know some devs there...)
