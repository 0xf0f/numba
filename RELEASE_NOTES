Version (0.17.1)
================

* Depends on numba 0.17.0
* Warns about incompatible numba version at import time
* Fixes some CUDA library APIs on windows

Version (0.17.0)
================

* Depends on numba 0.16.0

* Update occupancy autotuner for CC 5.0 and CC 5.2 devices
* Fix handling of empty array in GPU reduction
* Fix occupancy autotuner that may pick invalid blocksize


Version (0.16.0)
================
* Add `numbapro.cuda.reduce` for autogeneration of CUDA reduce kernels and
  driver.
* Fix device to host auto transfer logic in some ufunc function.
* Upgrades to Numba 0.15

Version (0.15.0)
================
* Add `numbapro.cudalib.sorting`:
    * Added GPU radixsort and radixselect using implementation from http://nvlabs.github.io/cub
    * Added GPU segmentedsort from http://nvlabs.github.io/moderngpu

Version (0.14.3)
================
* CUDA driver is initialized lazily

Version (0.14.2)
================
* Unify numba.cuda and numbapro.cuda backend

* Fixes workqueue module import for embedded python usecase

Version (0.14.1)
================
Fixes:

* UnboundReferenceError due to mishandling of incompatible driver (pre CUDA5.5
  driver).  The fix relaxes the driver requirement by allowing some features
  to fail on use.
* numbapro.cuda.* symbols are still exported when CUDA is not available.
  They would raise execption on use.

* Some of CUDA-python language feature is now opensourced as numba.cuda

Fixes:

* New CUDA driver system prevents freezing OSX on kernel launch error

Version (0.13.2)
================
* Fix problem with numpy 18 array scalar contiguousness

* Guard error due to mishandling of interleaved memory buffer (#60)
* Update to use Numba 0.12.1
* Fix powi bug

Version (0.13)
==============
* Add print statement for strings and scalar numeric types for debugging on GPU
* Add constant and local memory array allocation on GPU
* Add debug mode for GPU
* Allow raising exception classes on GPU
* Update CUDA toolkit libraries
* Fix boolean mapping


Version (0.12.7)
================
* Fix major bug that mistreats py2 division as inplace floor-division for real numbers.
* Fix using of array as argument of a CUDA device function.
* Delay initialization the CUDA subsystem upon first import of the cuda package.
* Add docstrings.


Version (0.12.6)
================
* Fix major bug that mistreats py2 division as floor-division for real numbers.

Version (0.12.5)
================
* Update to Numba 0.10.2

================
* Accept older driver by defering driver error to first use of specific API
* Report incompatible GPU at context creation
* Improve device information reporting
* Autotuning base on compiler info and occupancy calculator

Version (0.12.2)
================
* Distribute CUDA toolkit in Anaconda
* Better error message
* Fix gufunc signature parsing to accept trailing comma.
* Fix CUDA driver log info bug
* Support JIT linking

Version (0.12.1)
================
* Fix libNVVM search path (now accept directory path)
* Fix sign-extension error in forloop precondition
* Fix support for true-division

Version (0.12.0)
