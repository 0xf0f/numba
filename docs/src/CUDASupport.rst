CUDA Support
------------

All CUDA features are still in experimental stages. Computation speeds may have unexpected results.  CUDA cards with compute capability less than 1.3 do not support double-precision floating-point arithmetic.

CUDA features have been verified to work on Linux 32-bit and 64-bit.  On Windows, there is a known issue with CUDA Generalized UFunc.  CUDA features are not verified to work on Windows 32-bit, Mac 32-bit and Mac 64-bit.



**Supported**: Linux 32-bit and 64-bit.

**Partially supported**: Windows 64-bit. (Problem with CUDA GUFunc)

**Not verified**: Windows 32-bit, Mac 32-bit and Mac 64-bit.
